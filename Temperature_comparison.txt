Searching for relevant information...

Answer:
Windows Autopilot and Windows Autopilot device preparation are two different technologies used to set up and configure new devices for productive use. Windows Autopilot is a collection of technologies that enables users to set up and configure devices, while Windows Autopilot device preparation is a specific technology used to set up and configure devices before they are ready for use, with the goal of simplifying device deployment, delivering consistent configurations, and improving troubleshooting capabilities. Windows Autopilot device preparation is built on top of Windows Autopilot and is designed to work with Windows 11, version 23H2 or later, and Windows 11, version 22H2 with KB5035942 or later. Windows Autopilot device preparation is more focused on the deployment experience, while Windows Autopilot is more focused on the overall device configuration and setup process.

Answer:
Windows Autopilot and Windows Autopilot device preparation are two related but distinct technologies used to set up and configure new devices. Windows Autopilot is a collection of technologies used to set up and pre-configure new devices, getting them ready for productive use. Windows Autopilot device preparation is a subset of Windows Autopilot that simplifies device deployment by delivering consistent configurations, enhancing the overall setup speed, and improving troubleshooting capabilities. The main differences between Autopilot and Autopilot device preparation are:

* Autopilot is a broader technology that includes Windows Autopilot device preparation as one of its features.
* Autopilot device preparation is a more focused technology that is specifically designed to simplify device deployment and configuration.
* Autopilot device preparation is typically used for Windows 11 devices, while Autopilot can be used for Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices.
* Autopilot device preparation is more feature-rich than Autopilot, but it also has some limitations and requirements that need to be met.
* Autopilot device preparation is designed to work with Intune and Microsoft Entra ID, while Autopilot can work with other MDM providers.

In summary, Autopilot is a more general technology that includes Autopilot device preparation as one of its features, while Autopilot device preparation is a more focused technology that is specifically designed to simplify device deployment and configuration.
